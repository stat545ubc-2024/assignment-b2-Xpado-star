\title{Calculate Weighted Median}
\usage{
weighted_median(x, weights = NULL, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector for which to calculate the weighted median. Named 'x'
as it's a common convention for the main input in R functions.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of weights, must be the same length
as x. Default is NULL, which assigns equal weights. Named 'weights' for
clarity and consistency with other R functions.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds. Named 'na.rm' to be consistent with base R
functions and for its clear meaning (remove NA).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the weighted median.
}
\description{
This function computes the weighted median of a numeric vector, allowing for
custom weights and handling of NA values.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage
result1 <- weighted_median(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(paste("Basic usage result:", result1))

# Example 2: With custom weights
result2 <- weighted_median(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), weights = c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1))
print(paste("Custom weights result:", result2))

# Example 3: Handling NA values
result3 <- weighted_median(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("NA handling result:", result3))

# Example 4: Demonstrating an error
\dontrun{
weighted_median(c("a", "b", "c"))
}
